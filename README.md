# Antifennel

Turn Lua code into Fennel code. Does the opposite of what the Fennel
compiler does.

Somewhat immature, but it works on the 2250-line Fennel compiler with
no problems.

## Usage

    $ make
    $ antifennel targetfile.lua > targetfile.fnl

The `antifennel` script is self-contained and can be moved or
symlinked onto your `$PATH`; all it requires to run is LuaJIT.

Or during development, run without building:

    $ luajit antifennel.lua targetfile.lua > targetfile.fnl

## Current limitations

The Antifennel compiler assumes its input file is valid Lua; it does
not attempt to give good error messages when provided with files that
won't parse.

Antifennel assumes all locals are vars, even if they are not modified.

All assignments use `set-forcibly!` even when regular `set` would do
the trick, because we don't track the difference between locals that
come from `var` vs function parameters.

## Inherent Limitations

Fennel code does not support `goto`.

Early returns will compile to very ugly Fennel code, but they should
be correct.

Multiple values can be set, but only if the keys are static. For
instance, this is OK:

    tbl.field1.q, x = "QUEUE", 13

But this is not supported:

    tbl.field1[id], x = "IDENTIFIER", 99

The second example must be split into two separate assignments in
order to compile, since `tset` does not support multiple value
assignment in Fennel.
